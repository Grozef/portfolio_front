/* THANKS */

After a few years in another field of competence, a special thanks to everyone that made this adventure possible.

All my teachers from the CCI lyon, special thanks to Mr Albert, (i know he doesn't want me to display his name or his age ;),
Mr Thinkedou, the JS Master, The crowned spanish leader of PHP and Mr Ouvrier, the boss of technological survey, they will recognize themselves.

Thanks to all my coworkers from the CCI at HighConnexion. They help me start. Julien too.

I'm not gonna lie, The IT academy is kind of a bullshit school, don't go there. Some teachers are real experts though.
Thanks to my co-students, a hell of a class. Special thanks to Sofiane.

A very special thanks to my lead dev Alex. I don't know if he's ever gonna read this but i owe him one. A really big one.

Thank you to ALL employees from LAB, i cannot think of anyone who hasn't been nice to me.

And final thanks to my family and friends. I don't often say this out loud but i should.
